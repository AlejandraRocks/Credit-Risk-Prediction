# Credit Risk Prediction

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict credit card default risk using the UCI dataset. It demonstrates model development, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment-ready pipeline (FastAPI + Docker)
- Test-driven development with `pytest`

## Dataset
Source: [UCI - Default of credit card clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
